    # A python toolkit is useful because PythonToolkit (PTK) is an interactive environment for python. 
    #It was originally designed to provide a python based environment similiar to Matlab for scientists and
    #engineers when used together with the numpy, scipy and matplotlib python packages. However it can also be 
    #used as a general purpose interactive python environment especially for interactive gui programming.
    # It is built around a console window and simple python source editor and a Tool plugin system so that extra 
    # features and support for python packages can be easily added. 
    
    Example usage of 'print_container', a tool to print
any layout in a non-interactive way.
